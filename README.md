## About Me

I'm **Md Enayet Hossain**, a passionate software developer based in Dhaka, Bangladesh. With a love for solving complex problems and creating efficient, scalable software, I've been honing my skills in .NET development and Angular front-end technologies. From building microservices to full-stack applications, Iâ€™ve spent the last 6 months working on real-world projects, experimenting with new technologies, and contributing to the developer community.

I enjoy crafting solutions that are functional and user-friendly, but I also believe in writing clean, maintainable code that can stand the test of time. My goal is always to bridge the gap between user needs and technical possibilities, creating products that offer real value.

When Iâ€™m not coding, you can find me solving algorithmic challenges or deepening my knowledge of software architecture. I believe in lifelong learning and the power of collaboration to build something truly impactful.

## Experience ðŸ’¼

I recently completed an internship at **Itransition**, where I had the opportunity to work alongside talented engineers, developing and testing software solutions. It was a hands-on experience that allowed me to contribute to real-world projects, collaborate with a diverse team, and get my hands dirty with everything from deployment to integration. This internship solidified my love for building scalable and efficient software, and it was an invaluable learning experience.

## Recent Projects ðŸ’»

### Personal Collection Management Application
During the last few months, Iâ€™ve worked on a full-featured **Personal Collection Management Application**, which helps users manage and customize their collections. This project uses Angular on the front end, while the back end is powered by ASP.NET Core. I incorporated features like secure JWT authentication, multi-language support, and integrated Algolia for seamless search functionality. It was an exciting challenge to build something thatâ€™s both scalable and adaptable for future use cases.

### ASP.NET Microservices Architecture
In another project, I built a scalable **e-commerce application** using a microservices architecture. The system leverages Docker for containerization and RabbitMQ for handling asynchronous messaging between services. Designing a robust API layer and ensuring reliable inter-service communication was key to making this project a success.

### Console Game
For fun, I created a secure **Rock-Paper-Scissors game** that uses HMAC cryptography to ensure the integrity of each move. It was a neat way to explore cryptographic concepts while building something entertaining.
